Once a female turtle has successfully mated and has laid her eggs, the incubation period begins. The eggs are typically buried in sandy beaches or soft soil near water bodies. The female turtle selects the nesting site with care, ensuring that it is safe from predators and provides suitable conditions for the eggs to develop.</p>\n<img src='images/turtle-egg-2.jpg' class='img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block' alt='Turtle Egg 2'>\n<p>The incubation period of turtle eggs varies depending on the species and environmental conditions. It can range from a few weeks to several months. During this time, the eggs absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and the baby turtles develop inside the eggs.</p>\n<img src='images/turtle-egg-3.jpg' class='img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block' alt='Turtle Egg 3'>\n<p>Once the incubation period is over, the baby turtles hatch from the eggs and make their way towards the water. This is a critical and vulnerable stage for the hatchlings as they are exposed to numerous threats, including predators and human activities. They rely on their instincts and the natural cues of light and sound to find their way to the ocean.</p>\n</div>\n<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js'></script>\n</body>\n</html>",
