They are known for their longevity, with some species living for over a hundred years. Turtles are found in various habitats, including oceans, rivers, and even deserts.</p>\n  <p class=\"mt-3\">Turtles have adapted to their environments in interesting ways. Aquatic turtles have webbed feet or flippers that allow them to swim gracefully through water. Some turtles, like the box turtle, have a hinged shell that can be closed tightly to protect them from predators.</p>\n  <p class=\"mt-3\">Turtles are cold-blooded animals, which means that their body temperature varies with their surroundings. They rely on external sources of heat, such as the sun, to warm themselves. Turtles are also known for their ability to retract their heads and limbs into their shells when they feel threatened.</p>\n  <footer class=\"mt-5\">\n    <p>&copy; 2021 Turtle Conservation Society.
