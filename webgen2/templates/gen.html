<div class='container'><h1>Penguins</h1><p>Penguins are a group of flightless birds found in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. They are adapted to life in the water and spend most of their time swimming.</p><img src='./images/penguin1.jpg' alt='penguin1' class='img-fluid'><p>The penguin in the image above is a Gentoo penguin. Gentoo penguins are known for their bright orange bills and the distinctive white stripe that runs across the top of their heads.</p><p>Penguins have a streamlined body and wings that are modified into flippers. This allows them to swim through water with great speed and agility. Their short, rigid feathers help to reduce drag while swimming.</p><img src='./images/penguin2.jpg' alt='penguin2' class='img-fluid'><p>The penguin in the image above is a Chinstrap penguin. They are named after the thin black band under their heads, which resembles a chinstrap. Chinstrap penguins are known for their distinctive black and white coloring.</p><p>Penguins are excellent swimmers and can dive to great depths in search of food. They primarily feed on fish and squid. Some species of penguins can dive up to 1,800 feet (550 meters) deep and stay underwater for several minutes.</p><img src='./images/penguin3.jpg' alt='penguin3' class='img-fluid'><p>The penguin in the image above is an Emperor penguin. They are the largest species of penguins and can reach a height of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) and weigh up to 88 pounds (40 kilograms). Emperor penguins are known for their ability to survive in the harsh Antarctic conditions.</p><p>Penguins form colonies for breeding and nesting. They often construct nests out of pebbles and use their feet and flippers to incubate their eggs. Both the male and female penguins take turns incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks.</p></div><script src='https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js'></script><script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.5.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js'></script><script src='https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js'></script></body></html>
