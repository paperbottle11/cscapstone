    <p>Car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.</p>
    <p>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz built his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.</p>
    <p>Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex, but also more reliable and easier to operate.</p>
    <p class="quote">"The car has become an article of dress without which we feel uncertain, unclad, and incomplete in the urban compound."</p>
    <p>- Marshall McLuhan</p>
