They are efficient, environmentally friendly, and widely used around the world.</p><h2>1. Overhead Wires</h2><p>Electric trains get their power from overhead wires. These wires, also known as catenary wires, supply electricity to the train through a pantograph. The pantograph is a device that collects electricity from the overhead wires and transfers it to the train's electrical system.</p><img src='images/overhead_wires.jpg' alt='Overhead Wires' class='img-fluid'><p class='text-center'>Image 1: Overhead Wires</p><h2>2. Electric Motors</h2><p>Electric trains are equipped with electric motors that convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. These motors are responsible for powering the train's wheels and propelling it forward.</p><img src='images/motor.jpg' alt='Electric Motor' class='img-fluid'><p class='text-center'>Image 2: Electric Motor</p><h2>3. Power Distribution</h2><p>The power from the overhead wires is distributed to the electric motors and other electrical systems of the train. This ensures that all the necessary components receive the required electricity for proper functioning.</p><img src='images/power_distribution.jpg' alt='Power Distribution' class='img-fluid'><p class='text-center'>Image 3: Power Distribution</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Electric trains rely on a combination of overhead wires, electric motors, and power distribution systems to operate efficiently. Their use of electric power makes them a cleaner and more sustainable form of transportation.</p></div><script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js'></script></body></html>
