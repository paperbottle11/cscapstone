Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play ultimate frisbee:</p><h2>1. Gather your team</h2><p>To play ultimate frisbee, you need at least two teams with an equal number of players. Each team typically has 7 players on the field.</p><img src="images/team.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Team playing ultimate frisbee"><h2>2. Set up the field</h2><p>Mark the boundaries of the field using cones or other markers. The field should be rectangular with end zones at each end. The length of the field is usually around 70-100 yards.</p><img src="images/field.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Frisbee field"><h2>3. Start the game</h2><p>Decide which team will start with the disc. The game begins with a 'pull', where that team throws the disc as far down the field as possible. The receiving team then tries to catch the disc and advance it towards the opposing team's end zone.</p><img src="images/pull.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Starting the game"><h2>4. Play the game</h2><p>Once the disc is in play, the teams try to score points by passing the disc to their teammates in the opposing team's end zone. A player must throw the disc within 10 seconds and can't run while holding the disc.</p><img src="images/pass.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Passing the frisbee"><h2>5.
