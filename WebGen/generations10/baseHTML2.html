It uses an electric motor to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, which allows it to move. Electric trains have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and environmental benefits.</p><h3 class='mt-4'><b>Electric Motor</b></h3><p>The key component of an electric train is the electric motor. The electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, which is used to propel the train forward. The motor is usually located in the locomotive, which is the front part of the train.</p><img class='img-fluid mb-4' src='images/electric_motor.jpg' alt='Electric Motor'><p>The electric motor consists of a rotor and a stator. The rotor is the rotating part of the motor, while the stator is the stationary part. When an electric current is passed through the motor, it creates a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic field of the stator, causing the rotor to rotate.</p><h3 class='mt-4'><b>Power Source</b></h3><p>Electric trains require a source of electricity to power their motors. This electricity can be obtained from various sources, such as overhead lines, third rails, or onboard batteries. The most common method is to use overhead lines, where the train collects electricity through overhead wires.</p><img class='img-fluid mb-4' src='images/overhead_lines.jpg' alt='Overhead Lines'><p>The electricity from the overhead wires is transferred to the train through a pantograph, which is a device that makes contact with the overhead wires. The pantograph collects the electricity and transfers it to the train's electrical system, which powers the electric motor.</p><h3 class='mt-4'><b>Capacity</b></h3><p>Electric trains can vary in capacity depending on their design and purpose. They can range from small metro trains that carry hundreds of passengers to high-speed trains that can carry thousands of passengers. The capacity of an electric train is determined by factors such as the number of carriages, seating arrangement, and standing space.</p><img class='img-fluid mb-4' src='images/capacity.jpg' alt='Capacity'><p>Modern electric trains are designed to maximize passenger capacity while ensuring passenger comfort and safety. They are equipped with features such as spacious interiors, comfortable seating, and standing areas for crowded periods. Some electric trains also have designated areas for passengers with disabilities or special needs.</p><h3 class='mt-4'><b>Control System</b></h3><p>Electric trains also have a control system that allows the driver to regulate the speed and direction of the train. The control system consists of various components, including a throttle and a braking system. The throttle controls the amount of electrical power supplied to the motor, while the braking system controls the speed and stops the train.</p><img class='img-fluid mb-4' src='images/control_system.jpg' alt='Control System'><p>The control system is operated by the driver from the driver's cabin. The driver can adjust the throttle to increase or decrease the speed of the train. The braking system allows the driver to apply brakes gradually or abruptly, depending on the desired speed reduction.</p></div></body></html>
